To do list:

  - Backend
    [√] Change authentication.helper.ts to authentication.service.ts
    [√] Use a standalone approach to replace populateDb.ts logic
    [!] Check if it's possible to use monorepo configuration to define a configuration for main app and another for populate DB
      Even if it is possible to use monorepo feature for this, it doesn't make sense. It makes more sense to create another nest config
      file and start the nest application like this `nest start --config ./src/db/populate-database/nest-cli.json`
